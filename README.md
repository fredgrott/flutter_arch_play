# Flutter Arch Play

The gist here is I am building the bits and pieces of a skeleton app template with all the best practices that the Flutter SDK skeleton app template should have included.

It includes not on the code best practices but also some UX best practices as well.

I am doing this in small projects so that you can borrow and use the bits and pieces before the full improved skeleton app template is finished.

You can read about my progress on my medium blog:
